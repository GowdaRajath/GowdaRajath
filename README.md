## 🚀 About Me 
I am a Data & Insight Analyst with experience delivering customer-led analytics within regulated environments, including insurance and healthtech. My work focuses on analysing complex customer complaints and operational data to identify root causes, behavioural patterns, and systemic gaps that impact customer outcomes and business performance.

In my current role within the travel insurance sector, I work extensively with complaint and feedback data, investigating issues related to auto-renewals, medical disclosures, waiting lists, policy awareness, and agent behaviour. My analysis supports operational and leadership teams in refining processes, improving communication, and reducing avoidable customer dissatisfaction.

Previously, I contributed to the conceptual development of secure digital workflows within a healthtech environment, exploring how blockchain-based approaches can enhance data integrity, transparency, and trust in systems handling sensitive information.

I am particularly interested in building analytical frameworks that go beyond reporting, enabling data-driven decision-making, accountability, and measurable service improvement.

**Current Focus Areas**

- Customer Complaints Insight & Root Cause Analysis  
- Auto-Renewal & Policy Lifecycle Analytics  
- Decision-Focused Reporting for Non-Technical Stakeholders  
- Trust, Transparency & Data Integrity in Digital Systems
